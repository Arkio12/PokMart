# Cart Persistence Test

## Problem Fixed
The cart items were disappearing after page refresh because the mock user IDs from the authentication context weren't synchronized with the database. This caused foreign key constraint violations when trying to create carts for users that didn't exist in the database.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Created `/api/users` endpoint** - Syncs mock users with the database
2. **Updated AuthContext** - Now syncs users with database on login and page refresh
3. **Added debugging** - Better error handling and logging for troubleshooting

## Test Steps
1. **Login** with demo credentials:
   - User: `user@pokemart.com` / `user123`
   - Admin: `admin@pokemart.com` / `admin123`

2. **Add items to cart** from the shop page

3. **Refresh the page** - Cart items should persist

4. **Check browser console** - Should see logs like:
   ```
   Loading cart from database for user: b2c3d4e5-f6g7-8901-bcde-234567890001
   Cart data loaded: {items: [...]}
   ```

## Technical Details
- **Cart data** is stored in PostgreSQL database
- **User sessions** are managed via localStorage
- **Database sync** happens on login and page refresh
- **Error handling** improved with detailed logging

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Cart items persist after page refresh
- ✅ Cart items persist after browser restart (if logged in)
- ✅ Cart clears when user logs out
- ✅ Different users have separate carts
